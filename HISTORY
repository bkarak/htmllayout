HtmlLayout was created February 1998 by Paul Buchheit. The first 
version, unnamed, was released in March or April of 1998.

Version 0.9 was released May 1999. The major difference between
this version and the previous, unnamed, version is that it is
licensed under the LGPL. This version also attempts to be smarter
when there is not enough space available, although it is still 
not yet perfect.
